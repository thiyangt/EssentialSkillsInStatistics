# Which hypothesis test to perform?

in-class explanations

---

## Question 1

In a glaucoma study, intraocular pressure (IOP) values (in mm Hg) were recorded from a sample of 21 elderly subjects. The sample had the following characteristics:

$$n= 21$$
$$\bar{x}= 15.2 \text{mm Hg}$$
 $$s = 3.1 \text{mm Hg}$$
At a significance level of 0.05, can we conclude that the mean intraocular pressure of the population differs from 14 mm Hg? Perform a hypothesis test to determine the answer.

## Question 2

A market research company conducted a survey to investigate whether the type of beverage ordered with dinner at a restaurant independent of the age of the consumer. A random poll of 240 lunch customers is taken, resulting in the following contingency table of observed values. Can you conclude that the type of beverage ordered is independent of age?

## Question 3

A researcher wants to determine whether there is a significant difference in mean intraocular pressure (IOP) among three age groups of elderly subjects. The following data represent the recorded IOP values (in mm Hg) for each group:

Recorded IOP Values (mm Hg) for Each Age Group:

Group 1 (Age 60-65): 14, 15, 13, 16, 15, 14, 17, 16, 13, 15

Group 2 (Age 66-70): 17, 16, 15, 18, 14, 17, 16, 15, 19, 14, 18, 17

Group 3 (Age 71-75): 13, 12, 14, 15, 13, 12, 16, 14, 15, 13, 14

At a 0.05 significance level, can we conclude that the mean intraocular pressure differs among the three age groups?
